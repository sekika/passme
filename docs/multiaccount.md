# Multiple accounts

Sometimes you may have multiple accounts for the same site. While you can manage these by creating separate site entries (e.g., `google1`, `google2`), you might prefer to manage them under a single site name.

In this situation, you can share the same sitekey but produce different passwords by varying your **master password**.

For example:
*   Use your regular master password for your **main account**.
*   Append a specific word or suffix to your master password for your **second account**.

The rule for changing the master password can be stored in the comments section of the sitekey, along with the account ID.

**Example Comment:**
```text
Main Account: standard master pass
Sub Account: master pass + "sub"
```

This method is also useful when you have accounts for related regional sites, such as `amazon.com` and `amazon.co.jp`, and want to keep the sitekey list clean.
