# Javascript version

You may sometimes need to retrieve a password using a mobile device when you do not have access to your PC. For such situations, you can create an HTML file that generates passwords identical to those created by the `passme` command.

This HTML file can be generated by:

```bash
> passme html
```

1.  First, enter the desired **filename** for the HTML file.
2.  Next, specify the **site names** to be included. 
    *   Type `ALL` to include all sites.
    *   Or, select specific sites that you expect to access from your mobile device.

**The [created HTML file](https://sekika.github.io/passme/passme.html)**

### Usage

1.  Select the **site name** using the radio buttons.
2.  Enter your **Master Password** in the "Master" box. The password is regenerated instantly every time you type.
3.  Click the **Copy** button to copy the generated password to your clipboard.

You can send this HTML file to your mobile device (e.g., via Dropbox, iCloud, or email) and open it in any web browser.

**Note:** The character set **ans95** does not work in the Javascript version.
