Passme: Password management with command line
=======================

**Passme** is a password management tool with command line or `web browzer <javascript.rst>`_. It helps you generate strong passwords for many sites. It generates password every time from a site-specific seed (**sitekey**) stored in the configuration file (`sitekey file <sitekey.rst>`_) and a **master password** that you memorize and type every time.

* Sitekey + Master password = Password

The master password is not site specific, and therefore you have to remember only one master password. **Do not forget your master password or lose your sitekey file**, because once you lose one of them you will lose all the passwords and you can never recover them (otherwise it is not secure). The sitekey file could be managed with your private git repository.

Refer to `seurity <security.rst>`_ for more information on security.
